# Sprout - Git Worktree Terminal UI

A user-friendly terminal UI for managing git worktrees with integrated Linear workflow support.

## Overview

Sprout simplifies git worktree management by providing both interactive and command-line interfaces, with seamless Linear integration for ticket-based development workflows.

## Features

### Git Worktree Management
- **List existing worktrees**: View all worktrees with branch names, PR status, and commit information
- **Identify merge-ready worktrees**: List worktrees with merged PRs that are ready for pruning
- **Create worktrees from any location**: Generate new worktrees from the current repository, regardless of which worktree you're currently in
- **Flexible branch naming**: Optionally specify branch names or let Linear integration handle it automatically
- **Intelligent input parsing**: Enter as much or as little information as you want - Sprout figures out the rest

### Operating Modes
- **Interactive Mode**: Full terminal UI for browsing and managing worktrees and Linear tickets
- **One-shot Mode**: Command-line interface for quick worktree operations

### Linear Integration
- **Ticket-based worktrees**: Select Linear tickets to automatically create worktrees with suggested branch names
- **Task management**: Create new subtasks on Linear issues directly from the tool
- **Flexible ticket access**: 
  - View tasks assigned to you
  - Search and browse tasks beyond your assignments
- **Seamless workflow**: Skip manual branch naming by leveraging Linear's branch name suggestions

### User Experience
- **Smart input handling**: Provide partial information and let Sprout intelligently complete the workflow
- **Context-aware**: Understands your current git state and adapts accordingly
- **Minimal friction**: Streamlined workflows for common development tasks

## Getting Started

```bash
# Interactive mode
sprout

# List all worktrees with PR status
sprout list

# List worktrees with merged PRs (ready to prune)
sprout prune

# One-shot worktree creation
sprout create [branch-name]

# Create worktree and run command in it
sprout create [branch-name] [command] [args...]

# Check configuration and connectivity
sprout doctor
```

### Command Examples

```bash
# Create worktree and change to it
cd "$(sprout create mybranch)"

# Create worktree and open in VS Code
sprout create mybranch code .

# Create worktree and start a shell
sprout create mybranch bash

# Create worktree and run git status
sprout create mybranch git status
```

**Note**: When running commands with `sprout create`, the worktree directory is printed to stderr after command execution for easy reference.

## Requirements

- Go 1.21+
- Git 2.5+ (for worktree support)
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) for PR status information
- Linear API access (for Linear integration features)

## Configuration

Sprout supports configuration via `~/.sprout.json5` for customizing behavior:

```json5
{
  // Command to run after creating a worktree in interactive mode
  // If not specified, exits cleanly without running any command
  "defaultCommand": "code .",
  
  // Linear API key for issue tracking integration
  // Get your key from Linear Settings > Account > Security & Access
  "linearApiKey": "lin_api_YOUR_KEY_HERE"
}
```

### Configuration Options

- **`defaultCommand`**: Command to execute after creating a worktree in interactive mode. Common examples:
  - `"code ."` - Open in VS Code
  - `"nvim"` - Open in Neovim
  - `"bash"` - Start a new shell session
  
- **`linearApiKey`**: Your Linear personal API key for accessing Linear tickets. Required for Linear integration features.

### Linear Integration

When configured with a Linear API key, Sprout displays your assigned tickets in interactive mode:

```
ðŸŒ± Sprout - Create New Worktree

Enter branch name: â”‚

ðŸ“‹ Linear Tickets (Assigned to You):
   ABC-123 - Implement user authentication
   XYZ-456 - Fix database connection pooling
   DEF-789 - Add unit tests for payment module

Press Enter to create, Esc/Ctrl+C to quit
```

To get your Linear API key:
1. Go to Linear Settings > Account > Security & Access
2. Create a new personal API key
3. Add it to your `~/.sprout.json5` configuration

### Checking Configuration

Use the `doctor` command to verify your configuration and test Linear connectivity:

```bash
sprout doctor
```

This will show:
- Configuration file path and status
- Default command setting
- Linear API key (masked for security)
- Linear connection status and user information
